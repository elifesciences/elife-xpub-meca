## Examples

All the examples are not packaged in a zip file, rather they are the individual files to make it easier to view and modify. Packaging can be done in the standard way.

To see the difference between examples, run the following locally: `diff -r examples/alpha examples/beta`

Below are the list of examples.

### [beta](https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-xpub-meca/tree/master/examples/beta) (2019-04-01)

- Adds support for supplementary files.

### [alpha](https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-xpub-meca/tree/master/examples/alpha) (2018-09-18)

- This is the first example, which is meant to be a complete and valid example for a sunny-day test.
