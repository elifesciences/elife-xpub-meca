	<b>How will your work make others in the field think differently and move the field forward?</b>
</p>
<p>
	Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian nervous system is largely mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, chloride-selective members of the superfamily of pentameric Cys-loop receptors. Native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are heteromeric assemblies sensitive to many important drugs, from sedatives to anesthetics and anticonvulsant agents, with mutant forms of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors implicated in multiple neurological diseases.
</p>
<p>
	<b>How does your work relate to the current literature on the topic?</b>
</p>
<p>
	Despite the profound importance of heteromeric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in neuroscience and medicine, they have proven recalcitrant to structure determination.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Who do you consider to be the most relevant audience for this work?</b>
</p>
<p>
	Here we present the structure of a tri-heteromeric α1β1γ2S<sub>EM</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor in complex with GABA, determined by single particle cryo-EM at 3.1–3.8 Å resolution, elucidating molecular principles of receptor assembly and agonist binding.

	<b>Have you made clear in the letter what the work has and has not achieved?</b>
</p>
<p>
   Remarkable N-linked glycosylation on the α1 subunit occludes the extracellular vestibule of the ion channel and is poised to modulate receptor assembly and perhaps ion channel gating. Our work provides a pathway to structural studies of heteromeric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and a framework for rational design of novel therapeutic agents.
